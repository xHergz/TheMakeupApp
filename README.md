# TheMakeupApp :lips:
Capstone project for Software Engineering Technology by Justin and Keith.
## What is it?
The Makeup Application is a web app that will be used by makeup artists to create a dedicated portfolio and have a platform to provide their professional services. Artists will be able to sign up with information about the type of makeup services they provide and display a gallery of previous work to be found by potential customers. Artists will be able to provide 3 different types of service...
### Instant Consultation
The artist will mark themselves as "available" so that clients can find them in a search and then request a real time video consultation over our video chat built with [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).
### ASAP Makeover
The artist will mark themselves as "available" again so that clients can find them in a search and then request an ASAP Makeover appointment. This will consist of an instant consultation for the artist to gather an needed information before traveling to the clients location to perform the in person makeover.
### Future Appointment
The client will find an artist that fits their criteria and then request an appointment at some point in the future. The artist will confirm or decline the appointment request based on their availability. If it is confirmed the artist will contact the client for an instant consultation at some point before the scheduled makeover, and then travel to the agreed upon location for the in person makeover.
## When will it be ready?
We are aiming to have a polished prototype ready for SET Project Day which will be taking place in mid April.
## Where can I use this?
Our current plan is to make this a fully responsive web application so the user can use it however they prefer.
-Mobile (Through the Web View component of a native application)
-Mobile Browser
-Desktop Browser
## Who can use this?
We are targeting anyone who is a makeup enthusiast to be a client on our application. To become an artist you will have to have some credentials that you are a professional artist.
